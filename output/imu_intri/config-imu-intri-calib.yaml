#   The following parameters would be considered in calibration:
#   (1) the scale and non-orthogonal factor (matrix) of accelerator;
#   (2) biases of accelerator and gyroscope;
#   Attention: for static intrinsic calibration, the scale and non-orthogonal factor (matrix) of gyroscope
#   are lacking observability (for low-cost MEMS IMUs, which almost can not aware the earth rotation)

#   Multiple data pieces are required, they are collected stationary using different placement patterns.
#   For example, collect data using the same pattern  as the six-position calibration
